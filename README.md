# C Programming Practical Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various C programming practical questions. The solutions include code snippets, explanations, and examples where applicable. Each solution is designed to help understand key concepts and strengthen programming skills in C.

## Contents

- **Solutions to Practical Questions**: Each practical question has its corresponding solution implemented in C.
- **Code Files**: All solutions are in C code files (.c).
- **Documentation**: Short explanations for each solution to help understand the approach and logic used in solving the questions in the form of comments

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the directory containing the C program.
    ```bash
   cd path
   ```
2. Try compiling the program by
    ```bash
   gcc filename.c
   ```

    ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```
4. Then run the compiled file (for windows systems)
    ```bash
   ./a.exe
   ```
